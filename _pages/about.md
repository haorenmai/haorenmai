Hello, this is Haoren Mai (麦皓仁)'s Homepage!

Bio
======
I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate student at Wuhan University, and I have received a conditional offer for the PhD program at HKUST, where I will be supervised by [Professor Jian-Feng Cai](https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/~jfcai/). My research interests focus on Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Signal Processing. I am interested in Muon the Deep Learning Optimizer.

Gaokao
======
My Gaokao score was 655, ranking 1,449th out of 399,216 physics-track candidates in Guangdong Province in 2022.

Note: In the 2022 Guangdong Gaokao system, students were required to choose either Physics or History as a compulsory subject, resulting in two separate candidate categories: Physics-track and History-track.

Tutor, or Kaiban (开班)
======
I have provided paid tutoring services to multiple students, primarily in university-level mathematics courses such as Calculus, Partial Differential Equations, and Numerical Analysis. My students have consistently given highly positive feedback regarding my teaching effectiveness.
If you are interested, feel free to contact me. I am also available to tutor high school subjects across all areas.
